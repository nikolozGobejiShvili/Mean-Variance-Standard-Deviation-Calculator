# Statistical Analysis with Python and Numpy
This project demonstrates the use of Python and Numpy to perform statistical analysis on a 3 x 3 matrix. The core functionality is encapsulated in the calculate() function, which computes the mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum across both axes of the matrix and for the flattened matrix.

## Features
-Statistical Analysis: Perform comprehensive statistical calculations on a 3 x 3 matrix.
-Error Handling: Robust input validation to ensure the correct matrix size.
-Numpy Integration: Utilizes the power of Numpy for efficient numerical computations.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3
Numpy
